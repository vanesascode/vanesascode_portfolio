However, this property will give you an error in the console if you are working with React. It will tell you that 'window' is not defined.",
    paragraph2: "There's a library for that, and that is 'react-responsive'. This library provides a set of React components for building responsive UIs based on the viewport size. It simplifies working with media queries in React applications. Especifically, it has a custom hook that works just like the 'window.innerWidth', the 'useMediaQuery' hook. The following is a real example I used in this portfolio: ",

These properties allow you to specify the minimum and maximum values for the viewport width and height.",
    paragraph4: "When you use the useMediaQuery hook with the specified options, it returns a boolean value that indicates whether the media query condition is true or false based on the current viewport size.

Or you can uncomment the 'strictNullChecks' compiler option to make it throw errors when you have 'null' values in your code. This will help you to catch potential errors in your code before you go any further with it.",

In the command line, instead of typing 'git commit -m 'message', you can simply type 'git commit' and press Enter. This way, GitHub will prompt you to write a commit longer message in a new window inside VSCode. You then close and save, and you can continue with the next steps in the command line.

Then, in the commit body, provide more details about the changes made, explaining why they were necessary. Include any relevant context, such as issue numbers or references to related commits.",
    paragraph3: "Write commit messages in the present tense to describe what the commit does, rather than what it did. For example, use 'Add feature' instead of 'Added feature'. In fact, starting the subject line with an imperative verb, such as 'Add', 'Fix', 'Update', or 'Remove', helps to convey the intention of the commit.",
    paragraph4: "Each commit should have a clear and specific purpose. Avoid making unrelated changes in a single commit. If you have multiple changes, consider splitting them into separate commits.

In the example below, I am using the <ThreadCard/> component two times. However, the second time I want to add extra bottom margin in one of the classes lines. How can I do that?",

    gistIdIn: "7e1fdd41009cc069911893d663ee0ffb",

    paragraph2: "Well, one way is to add a prop to the component (only when you want the modification) that you can add to its code as a condition. If the prop is true, then the changes apply. That simple. In the example, it is the prop 'isComment'. So you just have to add a condition such as '${isComment && â€œmb-10}' (see below).",

    paragraph2: "The 'searchParams' property is derived from the query parameters in the URL of the browser. So, in the case of the main page mentioned before, the Next.js router automatically extracts the query parameters from the URL and provides them as an object called searchParams to the page. And why do we need it? Because we want to pass it to the 'fetchPosts function' in order to get our posts with pagination, for example (see function in the gist below). We are passing the page we are in as a prop, and then the action (the 'fetchPosts' function) can calculate how many posts it has to skip. And also, based on the amount skipped and the total posts and so, can calculate if the variable 'isNext' is true (which means, that indeed there are more posts to show in a next page).",

    gistIdIn2: "f853ed7cd8569cd3c4ca3b6a4b9c3098",
    paragraph3: "Since we are returning, not only the posts, but the 'isNext' variable as well, we can use this variable in the 'Pagination' component to enable or disable the buttons that the client will have to be able to change of page. And then the 'handleNavigation' function (inside the 'Pagination' component), is responsible for handling the navigation logic based on the button clicked ('Prev' or 'Next') and updating the URL accordingly. ",
    gistIdIn3: "bd7eb728fd0cfeab3f6e04446a2fefe2",

    paragraph4: "When the app first loads, the number of the pagination is obviously '1', since the searchParams are not receiving any '?page=' value from the URL yet (see: 'searchParams.page ? +searchParams.page : 1'). But when we press the 'Next' button inside the 'Pagination' component, we get the next page thanks to the 'handleNavigation' function doing its logic. However, as mentioned before, we also have to check if the 'isNext' variable is true or false. If it is true, we'll go to a next page. If it is false, there is no next page to go to. From then on, we are working with the '?page=' value in the props thanks to the searchParams. ",

    paragraph1: "The '?' after 'userInfo' (see example below) is called the 'optional chaining operator' in JavaScript. It is used to safely access nested properties or methods of an object without causing an error if any of the properties or methods are undefined or null. ",

    paragraph2: " In the example below, the code checks if the userInfo object exists and if the onboarded property is truthy. The thing is that when the user is created in the database, it then gets a boolean state of true in the onboarded property. ",
    gistIdIn2: "6440171227c44672b9985d20f39ba8db",
    paragraph3: "So, if userInfo is not onboarded, it means that userInfo itself is either undefined or null. In other words, it means that the userInfo object does not exist. Therefore, the condition if (!userInfo?.onboarded) is checking if the userInfo object does not exist or if the onboarded property of userInfo is falsy. If either of these conditions is true, it means that the user is not onboarded and the code will redirect the user to the '/onboarding' page. ",
    paragraph4: "If the '?' chaining operator wasn't there in the example above, it would throw an error if the userInfo object was null or undefined, and the app could unfortunately crash.",
